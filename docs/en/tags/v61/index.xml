      <description>1. Dungeon  Decreased difficulty of Alpha Cyrux Research Facility  Decreased damage of certain skills for each boss Increased stun duration of 1st boss after tackling tree Decreased penalty/damage of explosive goblins during 3rd boss    Developer comment (paraphrased; point form)
 Too many players were trying to take advantage of the market by obtaining tradeable items from Token/Mark of Change and eventually trading gold for real money so they changed items to be untradeable.</description>
