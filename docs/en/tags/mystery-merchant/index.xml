      <description>Mystery Merchant is an NPC that sells goods in exchange for special currency called Mystery Merchant Coin. For the sake of simplicity, there are two different types of merchants: City Merchant and Wandering Merchant.
City Merchant City Merchants are merchants located specific in the 4 major cities : Velika, Allemantheia, Kaiator, and Highwatch. City Merchant locations are marked on the minimap, making them easy to find. A global system message &amp;ndash; that Mystery Merchant Starc has appeared in one of the 4 major cities &amp;ndash; signals that the City Merchant associated to the city will open in 5 minutes.</description>
