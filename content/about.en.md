Hi, my name is seraphinush aka. seraph and i translate K TERA patch notes and more. aside from that i'm just your average TERA player with subpar DPS playing my main Archer on Velika, NA TERA and Glory of Arun, K TERA.

This blog hosts translations of K TERA patch notes and articles that i've written. all the background images are screenshots that i've taken personally within the game. if you would like to use them yourself, please leave a credit in some way or form just as a small token of appreciation.

If you have any questions, my discord tag is [**seraphinush#5417**](https://discord.gg/A64RcA5) and i'll be happy to answer any question to the best of my knowledge.
