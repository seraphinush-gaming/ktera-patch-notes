Developer comment

신규 장비의 전투 성능이 향상되면서 전체적인 던전의 클리어 타임이 짧아지게 되었고, 더불어 특정 클래스의 경우 아주 짧은 시간 동안 강력한 공격이 가능하여 다른 클래스보다 더 빠르게 바하르 1페이즈를 클리어하고 쿨타임을 기다리며 2페이즈를 준비할 수 있었습니다.
그리고 이러한 현상은 바하르의 1페이즈와 2페이즈 사이의 대기 시간은 순위 기록으로 측정하지 않아 다른 클래스와의 기록 경쟁에서 우위를 차지하는 문제로 있어졌으며, 이를 개선하여 공정한 기록 측정을 진행하기 위해 기준을 변경하게 되었습니다.
