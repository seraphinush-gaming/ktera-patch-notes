Mahtnan gear (pl.) is the new gear set added v108, as part of a new season of TERA, namedly TERA : AWAKE. 

Mahtnan gear (pl.) differentiates itself from the previous Kaia's Soul gear set by removing damage on enchant, and Infusion options. This makes it one of the easiest gear set to enchant due to the removal of artificial enchanting difficulty, but other factors have been added to make Mahtnan gear (pl.) just as problematic as it was before.

Mahtnan gear (pl.) is divided into 3 rarities : Rare, Superior, and Mythic, and enchantment is available up to +12.

There is no upgrade to Mahtnan gear (pl.), but the newly added Succession system (pl.) allows players to transfer enchantment level, random options, and Etching from one gear to another.

Mahtnan gear (pl.) has 3 types of options : Basic options, Random options, and Support options.

## Random options
Random options are inherited from Kaia's Soul gear and operates similarly. 

## Support options
Support options are new additions to gear options. Support options are further divided into Unique option and Support Random option. Different from regular Random options, Support options cannot be changed. Support Random options also have relatively higher values than regular Random options.

### Unique option
Unique options are divided into tier I to tier V, and effect values vary appropriately.
