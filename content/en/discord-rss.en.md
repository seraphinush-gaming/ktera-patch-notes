## Using Discord for RSS-based update notification

RSS is available via `https://tera-mysterium.com/en/index.xml`.

For non-technical users, feel free to join this Discord server for tera-mysterium update notifications:

In the `#public-bot` text channel, type `.iam tera-mysterium` to self-assign the said role through a Discord bot -- the text channel for tera-mysterium website update will then become visible.

The text channel can be followed to be updated in other Discord servers.
