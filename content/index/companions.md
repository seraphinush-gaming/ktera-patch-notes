# Companion
**Pets** and **Partners** together are called Companions, and are support creatures players can summon to help you with your gameplay. In the past, Companions were simply Pets that you can summon from your Skill UI. From v81 with the addition of Partners and onward, both are accessed from the Companion UI. Pets that have special **Abilities**  can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage. Pet Skills and their description is of the following :

Pets can grow and level up by feeding them a big variety of items including Talents, Feedstock, Gear and various food items among many others. Once a Pet grows to Level 10, it can use an **Evolution Core** for a chance to evolve into a random Partner. Failure to do so drops its level down to Level 9, and you'll need to feed it again to get it back to Level 10. Two Pets can also be **combined** to become a random Pet, or even a random Partner at a low chance. The higher the grades of the Pets, the more likely it is for the two to be combined into a Partner. Note that combining two Grade 10 Pets is guaranteed to yield a random Partner. Evolving or Combining Pets will lose their Pet Skills.

**Partners** are specialized Companions. What makes Partners most valuable is their **Bond Skill**, which provides valuable combat support. Partners also have one random passive skill called **Gifted Skill** that can be triggered randomly depending on how much Stamina the Partner has. Partners can **Train** to take and learn Pet Skills from different Companions, so make sure to take Pet Skills from Pets before Evolving or Combining Pets.

Partners start at Grade 1 and Fellowship 1 and can be **Promoted** by consuming another Partner. Promoting a Partner increases its Grade by 1, and improves Fellowship by a random value. Partners cannot go past Grade 10, and therefore can only be promoted 9 times.

At level 66, you can get your first Partner from **Hatching a Partner** quest given by Loomey the Wanderering Scholar in Highwatch. While the obtained Partner does not gain more Fellowship from being Promoted, it can be used to promote another Partner.

# Fellowship
Fellowship is what determines how effective your Partner's **Bond Skill** is. By promoting your Partner, Fellowship of your Partner will increase. While Fellowship caps at 50, the amount of Fellowship increased at each Promotion varies depending on the Grade of the sacrificed Partner.

The obtained Fellowship for a Partner is of the following :

While heavily dependent on RNG, it is highly recommended to Promote a Partner sacrificing Grade 8 or higher Partners in order to maximize the potential Fellowship gain. The difference between Grade 8 Partner vs. Grade 10 Partner is that there is a higher chance to increase Fellowship by 5 (and a lower chance to increase Fellowship by 4), but the chance to increase Fellowship by 6 does not change.

For an uncommon Partner, 39 Fellowship is the minimum to maintain Bond Skill indefinitely, whereas for Rare and Superior Partner, 37 and 35 Fellowship is the minimum, respectively.

# Bond skill : Power
Select Partners can provide **Power** for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high your Partner's Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Four Partners -- **Marie**, **Kuncun**, **Cocomin**, and **Loo** -- have been released to have **Bracing Force** as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time.

The obtained Power and its duration for a Partner of Uncommon, Rare, and Superior rarity is of the following :

# Bond skill : Amplification
Select Partners can provide **Amplification** for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high your Partner's Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Two Partners -- **Rico**  and **Eco** -- have been released to have **Robust Energy** and **Vibrant Energy** as their Bond Skill, which increases Physical Amplification and Magical Amplication (respectively) for a set duration of time.

The obtained Physical / Magical Amplification and its duration for a Partner of Uncommon, Rare, and Superior rarity is of the following :

# Gifted Skill
Gifted Skills are secondary support skills specific to Partners, and provide auxillary support in or out of combat. Gifted Skills and their description is of the following :
![](https://seraphinush-gaming.github.io/mysterium/images/index/companions_gifted_skill_table.png)

Each Partner species is restricted to a set of Gifted Skills. The available Gifted Skills for each Partner species is of the following :

A **Gifted Skill Change Voucher** is needed in order to change a Partner's Gifted Skill. The said item can be purchased with **Mystery Merchant Coins** from wandering **Mystery Merchants** randomly appearing in Val Oriyn, Northern Arun. Gifted Skill Gifted Skill Change Voucher
