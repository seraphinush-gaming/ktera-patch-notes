### 1. Skill
- Berserker
  - Vampiric Strike, Lethal Strike
  - Revised issue where damage was significantly low at high HP
    - The following is the HP and damage ratio:
    - HP 100-90%: 1.0 times, HP 90-80%: 1.1 times
    - Damage onward will increase by 1.1 times per 10% HP (Max at HP 10-0%: 2.0 times)
    - Note: Probably means that each decremenet of 10% HP will result in “additional” 0.1 times damage.
- Slayer
  - Knockdown Strike
    - Changed so that Knockdown Strike can be chained from the 1st and 2nd hit of Distant Blade as well
    - Fixed issue where casting speed of Knockdown Strike was significant faster than intended
- Lancer
  - Backstep
    - Changed animation to take effect from Attack Speed, while making the iframe last just before the end of the animation static

### 2. Battleground
  - On December 1st, there was an update on battleground matching algorithm
    - Due to server crashes as a result of the change, the algorithm has been reverted back to the original algorithm

### 3. Quest
  - Added Avatar weapons to quest received upon reaching level 65
    - Details
