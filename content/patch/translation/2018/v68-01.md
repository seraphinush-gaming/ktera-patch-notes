Developer comment
- In accordance to adding new dungeons without retiring old dungeons, rewards for existing dungeons have been adjusted with the addition of new dungeons (Rebel's Hideout, Rebel's Hideout (hard)). loot has been evenly distributed, and changed Vanguard Initiative bonus reward to gems in order to obtain both gold and enchanting materials appropriately. Through this redistribution of rewards, more can be obtained by playing various dungeons and less can be obtained by playing select few dungeons. we will continue to observe and adjust in order to prevent both new and old dungeons from being neglected.
