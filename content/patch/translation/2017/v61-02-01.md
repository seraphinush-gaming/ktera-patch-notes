### 1. Dungeon
- Decreased difficulty of Alpha Cyrux Research Facility
  - Decreased damage of certain skills for each boss
  - Increased stun duration of 1st boss after tackling tree
  - Decreased penalty/damage of explosive goblins during 3rd boss

Developer comment (paraphrased; point form)
- Too many players were trying to take advantage of the market by obtaining tradeable items from Token/Mark of Change and eventually trading gold for real money so they changed items to be untradeable.
- Existing old materials are still tradeable, but
- Remakes of old materials that are untradeable replace the tradeable ones in the Token/Mark of Change shops
- Existing old materials will now dismantle to Mark of Change instead of Token of Change
- Increased gold reward from Vanguard Iniative quest due to difficulty enchanting

### 2. Item

    - War Keybadge
